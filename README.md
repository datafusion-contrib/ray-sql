# RaySQL: DataFusion on Ray

This is an experimental research project to evaluate the concept of performing distributed SQL queries from Python, using
[Ray](https://www.ray.io/) and [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion).

## Example

See [examples/tips.py](examples/tips.py).

```python
import ray
from raysql.context import RaySqlContext
from raysql.worker import Worker

# Start our cluster
ray.init()

# create some remote Workers
workers = [Worker.remote() for i in range(2)]

# create context and plan a query
ctx = RaySqlContext(workers)
ctx.register_csv('tips', 'tips.csv', True)
ctx.sql('select sex, smoker, avg(tip/total_bill) as tip_pct from tips group by sex, smoker')
```

## Status

- Partially working. Can run a few TPC-H queries.

## Features

- Mature SQL support (CTEs, joins, subqueries, etc) thanks to DataFusion
- Support for CSV and Parquet files

## Limitations

- Requires a shared file system currently

## Performance

This chart shows the relative performance of RaySQL with other open-source distributed SQL frameworks.

Only a few queries work, and performance does not look very promising so far, but this may just be because of the na√Øve 
distributed planner introducing unnecessary shuffles.

## Building

```bash
# prepare development environment (used to build wheel / install in development)
python3 -m venv venv
# activate the venv
source venv/bin/activate
# update pip itself if necessary
python -m pip install -U pip
# install dependencies (for Python 3.8+)
python -m pip install -r requirements-in.txt
```

Whenever rust code changes (your changes or via `git pull`):

```bash
# make sure you activate the venv using "source venv/bin/activate" first
maturin develop
python -m pytest
```

## Benchmarking

Create a release build when running benchmarks, then use pip to install the wheel.

```bash
maturin build --release
pip install ./target/wheels/raysql-0.1.0-cp37-abi3-manylinux_2_31_x86_64.whl --force-reinstall
```

## How to update dependencies

To change test dependencies, change the `requirements.in` and run

```bash
# install pip-tools (this can be done only once), also consider running in venv
python -m pip install pip-tools
python -m piptools compile --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
```

To update dependencies, run with `-U`

```bash
python -m piptools compile -U --generate-hashes -o requirements-310.txt
```
